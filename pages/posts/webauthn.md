In our daily online routines, safeguarding our accounts and sensitive information is crucial. However, managing numerous passwords can be cumbersome. What if there was a simpler way? Web Authentication (also known as **WebAuthn**) is the global standard for **passwordless authentication**, that eliminates the need for passwords. It redefines how we access our accounts online, making the reliance on passwords a thing of the past.   

WebAuthn is an API standard developed by the **World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)**, revolutionizes user authentication by enabling servers, applications, websites, and various systems to authenticate users using **public key cryptography** instead passwords. This specification, supported by major web browsers like Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, and Safari, as well as their mobile counterparts, leverages public-key cryptography.

> **"This specification defines an API enabling the creation and use of strong, attested, scoped, public key-based credentials by web applications, for the purpose of strongly authenticating users."**
> --- By specification

### Three Major properties:
* **Strong:** This refers to the high level of security offered by WebAuthn. It employs robust cryptographic techniques, **ensuring that the authentication process is resistant to various types of attacks, including phishing and credential theft**.    
* **Scoped:** WebAuthn credentials are scoped, meaning they are specific and limited in their use. These credentials are designed for particular purposes or domains, **ensuring that they can't be misused or applied outside of their intended scope.**
* **Attested:** Attestation involves the verification of the authenticity of devices used for authentication. WebAuthn supports attestation, allowing relying parties (such as servers or websites) to verify the legitimacy of the device or platform used by the user for authentication. **This ensures that only trusted devices are utilized for login.**

### History of WebAuthn:

### How does WebAuthn works:
The WebAuthn APIs comprises three components to enable passwordless authentication on a website or application:
- **Authenticator:** creates and stores user credentials. In traditional password authentication, the user memorizes the credentials. WebAuthn requires the credentials to be stored on a device. Generally, the authenticator is stored on a biometric USB device, a security key, or can be embedded into a mobile or laptop operating system. WebAuthn can authenticate users with facial recognition or fingerprint scanning.
- **Client:** is the software that allows the implementation of a WebAuthn API. This could be a web browser, application, or operating system. 
- **Relying Party:** is a server or a service that needs to authenticate users securely. This entity relies on WebAuthn's framework to confirm the identity of users trying to access its services or systems.

### Registering a user:
In contrast to the traditional password-based user registration flow, where passwords are sent to the server for storage, WebAuthn operates differently. The authenticator generates a new set of public-key credentials specifically to sign challenges generated by the relying party. These new credentials' public part, along with the signed challenge, is then transmitted back to the relying party for storage. Subsequently, the relying party utilizes these credentials to verify the user's identity whenever necessary.

Registering for WebAuthn requires only a few simple step from the user and the API and authenticator do the rest:
1. The user initiates the new account enrollment process.
2. The web server sends data to bind the WebAuthn client and the user to the credential. 
3. The WebAuthn API prompts the user to select an authenticator to create a key pair. 
4. The authenticator stores the public and private keys, but only the public key is sent to the web server.
5. The web server validates the authenticator's response and stores the user's data and public key to complete the enrollment.

### Authenticating a user
Enabling the relying party to issue a challenge to the authenticator. The authenticator then signs this challenge using the previously generated public-key credentials and returns the signed response to the relying party. Through this process, the relying party can verify the user's possession of the required credentials, thereby confirming their identity.

Once a user has registered their authenticators with a web server, app authentication is possible using WebAuthn as a standalone passwordless solution. The WebAuthn login process looks a little like this:

1. The user navigates to a website or web app to initiate their login request.
2. Web server sends a request to the browser, prompting the user to select an authentication method.
3. Web server sends a challenge to the authenticator, which the user must complete using their fingerprint, their voice, or facial recognition.
4. The authenticator decrypts the private key and sends a signature to the web server.
5. If the signature is validated against the public key, the user gains access to the system.

### Commonly used terms and acronyms:
**Public key Cryptography** - Developed in the 1970s, addressed the challenge of securely sharing secrets over the internet. It stands as a fundamental element of online security. For instance, when we visit a secure website with HTTPS, there's a process where a public key is used to establish a secure connection between our device and the website. This ensures that our information remains private and secure during our online interactions.
